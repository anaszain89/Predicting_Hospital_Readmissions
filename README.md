# Predicting_Hospital_Readmissions
Results/codes from healthcare data hackathon

This repo contains some software that was used when participating in the following challenge. 

Contains codes/ideas contribution from Sanchita Agarwal and Adora D'Souza

[Predicting Hospital Readmissions](http://rochackhealth.com/healthcare-deep-data-dive-2016/2016_chal1/)
In this challenge, your team will try to predict which patients will be re-admitted to the hospital after being discharged from a hospital stay.  This is a real problem for hospitals, who donâ€™t get paid for a re-admission if it happens <30 days after the patient was discharged.  There are a million companies trying to develop algorithms to do this, so here is your chance to show your stuff.  You will be given a training data set of several files, and will need to assemble them and train your algorithm.  You are free to use any algorithm you wish that your team codes, or combine several. 


Our team were declared the [winners for the competition](http://rochackhealth.com/healthcare-deep-data-dive-2016/winners2016/)

In this repo we try to re-analyze the data made available during the challenge in Python with an attempt to improve the results we had obtained then.
